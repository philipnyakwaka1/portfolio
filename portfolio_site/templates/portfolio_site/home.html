        <div class="about-text-content">
            <p>I am a Geospatial Engineer by training with a fervent love for technology. My professional mission is to integrate advanced Geographic Information Systems (GIS) expertise with robust software engineering principles to build cutting-edge, cloud-native geospatial solutions. By leveraging my Python and backend development skills, I aim to democratize geospatial data access by architecting scalable, free, and affordable open-source tools.</p>
            <div id="more-about-content" class="hidden-content">
                <p>While working at various organizations in Kenya, I discovered how technology could address various spatial problems. One pertinent drawback wasn't necessarily the lack of proprietary systems, but the inability to appropriate capital for relevant systems. Nevertheless, there was a need to customize existing systems to suit organizational needs. It was apparent to me that I wanted to play a pivotal role in democratizing the use of geospatial data by building free and affordable geospatial solutions and contributing to open-source geospatial projects.</p>
                <p>In pursuit of my ambitions, I discovered the field of geospatial application development. To thrive in this field, I had to begin by understanding the basics of computing. Luckily for me, I have always had an enormous curiosity about how systems work at their most fundamental level. I then enrolled in a one-year software engineering course at ALX Africa and specialized in backend technologies within the last three months of the program. The intensive 70-hour-a-week curriculum equipped me with the foundational computer science knowledge to decompose complex applications to their most fundamental truth and build solutions from the ground up. I am now a backend engineer capable of designing and deploying full-stack geospatial web applications.</p>
                <p>My core technical stack includes Python, Django, Flask, JavaScript, SQL, Docker, and Google Maps cloud APIs. My career trajectory is not defined by a transition away from GIS, but by a strategic integration of these software skills with high-accuracy spatial analysis.</p>
                <p>To accelerate this vision, I am exploring postgraduate studies in advanced computational methods, including Deep Learning in Remote Sensing and GIS Algorithms and Programming. Ultimately, I am passionate about pioneering a startup in the geospatial development space.</p>
                <p>This platform serves as my digital laboratory where I commit to building in public by documenting my learning journey, sharing my research, and detailing my project builds. Recognizing that accountability is the cornerstone of achieving ambitious goals, I am dedicating this process to you and the community to ensure consistent progress and continuous development.</p>
                <p>If you are a self-taught developer, a GIS professional exploring coding, or someone interested in the intersection of AI and geospatial data, I believe you'll find something relevant here. Your thoughts, feedback, and comments on my posts are highly valued, as they help drive my continuous development and ensure the work remains relevant and impactful.</p>
